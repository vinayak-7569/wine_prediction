 Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to classify red wine quality using physicochemical properties. The objective is to predict wine quality levels categorized as Low, Medium, and High based on features like alcohol, acidity, sulphates, and more. The final model, built using a RandomForestClassifier, achieved a validation accuracy of **86.88%**. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and saving the model for deployment.

## Key Achievements
- **86.88% Accuracy**: Achieved using RandomForestClassifier with engineered features
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom features such as alcohol_sulphates and acid_ratio improved performance
- **Production Ready**: Trained model and reusable prediction script are saved
- **Clean Pipeline**: Fully modular and maintainable ML architecture

Model	Accuracy	Notes
Random Forest	86.88%	Final selected model (3 classes)
Baseline Model	~70.0%	Before feature engineering

Key Features
ðŸ”§ Feature Engineering
alcohol_sulphates: Interaction of alcohol and sulphates

acid_ratio: Balance of fixed and volatile acidity

alcohol_quality_proxy: Alcohol scaled with quality indicator

ðŸŽ¯ Classification Approach
Target variable grouped into three classes:

Low Quality: 3â€“4

Medium Quality: 5â€“6

High Quality: 7â€“8

Addressed imbalance using class weights

ðŸš€ Production Artifacts
Trained model (production_wine_model.joblib)

Feature list (feature_names.joblib)

Inference script (wine_predictor.py)

Technical Stack
